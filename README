Creative Repository Browser
---------------------------

A Django powered Subversion browser with visual previews and
a post commit hook for creating thumbnails.

Installation
------------

Currently, CRB must be installed on the same machine as the repository.

1. Create a folder to contain thumbnails and make sure the uid the
svn server runs as can write to this folder.

2. Copy post-commit to the hooks/ folder of your repository.  Make
sure it has execute permissions.  Edit post-commit to point to your
thumbnails folder

3. If you have an existing repository, note the HEAD revision and
run something like this

{{{
HEAD=1234
for s in seq 1 $HEAD;
do
  /path/to/post-commit /path/to/repos $s
done
}}}

4. Edit live.wsgi as you usually would for a Django project.
